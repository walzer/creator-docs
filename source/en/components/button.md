# Button component reference

The button component responds to a click from the user. When the user clicks a Button, its status will change. In addition, users can assign a custom behavior to buttons' click event.

| customEventData | A user-defined string value passed as the last event argument of the event callback.             |
  

#### Detailed explanation

Button currently only supports the On Click event. This means only when users click and release the Button will the corresponding call-back function be triggered.

#### Add a callback through the script code

##### Method one

This method adds the same event callback as the event callback that is added using the editor，By adding code, you need to first construct a `cc.Component.EventHandler` object, and then set the corresponding target, component, handler and customEventData parameters.

```js
//here is your component file, file name = MyComponent.js 
cc.Class({
    extends: cc.Component,
    properties: {},
    
    onLoad: function () {
        var clickEventHandler = new cc.Component.EventHandler();
        clickEventHandler.target = this.node; //This node is the node to which your event handler code component belongs
        clickEventHandler.component = "MyComponent";//This is the code file name
        clickEventHandler.handler = "callback";
        clickEventHandler.customEventData = "foobar";

        var button = node.getComponent(cc.Button);
        button.clickEvents.push(clickEventHandler);
    },

    callback: function (event, customEventData) {
        //here event is a Touch Event object, you can get events sent to the event node node
        var node = event.target;
        var button = node.getComponent(cc.Button);
        //here the customEventData parameter is equal to you set before the "foobar"
    }
});
```

##### Method two

By `button.node.on ('click', ...)` way to add, this is a very simple way, but the way there are some limitations in the event callback which can not
Gets the screen coordinate point of the current click button.

```js
//Suppose we add an event handler callback to the onLoad method of a component and handle the event in the callback function:

cc.Class({
    extends: cc.Component,
	
    properties: {
       button: cc.Button
    },
    
    onLoad: function () {
       this.button.node.on('click', this.callback, this);
    },
    
    callback: function (event) {
       //here the event is an EventCustom object, you can get through the event.detail Button component
       var button = event.detail;
       //do whatever you want with button
       //In addition, attention to this way registered events, can not pass customEventData
    }
});
```
